# MAIN PITCH: The Sell

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Tag line**           ***While other AI assistants forget after a few
                         files, Claude analyzes your entire
                         codebase---and remembers it tomorrow.***
  ---------------------- ------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

Claude\'s revolutionary 200K context window can analyze entire codebases
in a single conversation---500+ files simultaneously. Combined with
Projects for persistent memory and Claude Code\'s agentic capabilities,
developers finally have an AI assistant that remembers project
architecture, decisions, and coding patterns across sessions. This
course teaches the complete Claude ecosystem: from constitutional AI
foundations through production deployment.

You\'ll master Claude Projects for persistent context, Artifacts for
live code execution, then level up with Claude Code CLI and its powerful
Skills system for extensibility and Agents for autonomous coding
workflows. MCP servers give Claude access to GitHub, Slack, and internal
APIs. By course end, you\'ll have production-ready Claude integrations
including CI/CD pipelines, automated code review bots, and team adoption
strategies.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Marketing            Claude is the most admired LLM among developers
  Information**          (Stack Overflow 2025), with 45% of professionals
                         using Claude Sonnet. Yet no comprehensive
                         training covers Projects, Skills, and Agents as
                         an integrated system. Developers need to
                         understand the complete Claude ecosystem---not
                         just basic prompting. This course delivers
                         production-ready implementations tested with
                         live O\'Reilly audiences.

## Size of Market

-   47.2M developers worldwide, 36.5M professional (SlashData, 2025)

-   45% of professional developers use Claude Sonnet for development
    (Stack Overflow, 2025)

-   Claude Sonnet: most admired LLM among developers (Stack Overflow,
    2025)

-   AI coding tools market: \$7.37B in 2025, projected \$30.1B by 2032
    (27.1% CAGR)

## Conferences

## Competition

No comprehensive video course covers Claude and Claude Code as an
integrated ecosystem including Projects, Skills, and Agents. Existing
content focuses on basic prompting or treats features in isolation.
GitHub Copilot courses dominate AI coding assistant training, but
Claude\'s unique capabilities require dedicated coverage. This course
fills the gap with production implementations tested with live O\'Reilly
audiences.

## Strategic Fit

-   Complements existing GitHub Copilot courses with Claude-specific
    deep dive

-   Pairs with Context Engineering with MCP for complete AI memory
    coverage

-   Extends prompt engineering foundations into agentic AI
    implementation

-   Positions Pearson as multi-platform AI assistant leader: Copilot +
    Claude coverage

## Timeline

Fast-turnaround: Direct adaptation from battle-tested O\'Reilly live
course (Claude Code and Large-Context Reasoning). Full outline and
scripts within 1-2 weeks of approval. Course repository ready at first
recording session. All demonstrations tested with live audiences.
