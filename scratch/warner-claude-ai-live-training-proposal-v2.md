### Description

**Key Highlights:**
- **Deep-dive Claude's unique capabilities:** Projects, Artifacts, MCP servers, and computer use API for next-gen development.
- **Master Claude Code CLI:** Terminal-first workflows that enterprise developers actually need.
- **Build production systems:** Not just prompts! Architect Claude-powered CI/CD pipelines and automation.

**Summary:**

While other AI assistants lose context after a few files, Claude's revolutionary 200K context window can analyze entire codebases in a single conversation - and with Model Context Protocol (MCP), that intelligence persists across sessions. This course teaches developers how to leverage Claude's unmatched context capabilities for real-world development, from analyzing legacy systems to building persistent AI memory that actually remembers your project architecture, decisions, and coding patterns.

You'll master Claude's large-context reasoning through practical examples, then level up with MCP servers that give Claude persistent memory about your codebase - no more re-explaining your project every session. Using simple JSON-based storage, you'll build MCP servers that remember your API schemas, architectural decisions, and team conventions. By session's end, you'll have a production-ready Claude setup that maintains context across days, weeks, even months of development - something Copilot can't even attempt. This is Claude for developers who want their AI assistant to have actual memory, not amnesia.

> **Note:** This course focuses on universal development patterns across all languages, complementing language-specific Claude courses. While others teach syntax, we teach systems.

### What You'll Learn and How You Can Apply It

By the end of this live online course, you'll be able to:

- Analyze entire codebases with Claude's 200K context window - review 500+ files simultaneously
- Build MCP memory servers that persist project knowledge in simple JSON stores
- Create codebase intelligence that remembers architectural decisions, API patterns, and team conventions
- Deploy persistent Claude workflows that maintain context across sessions, PRs, and sprints

---

### This Live Event Is For You Because…

- You're tired of re-explaining your project context to AI assistants every single session
- You want an AI that can actually see your entire codebase, not just snippets
- You need persistent memory for your team's coding patterns, decisions, and conventions

---

### Prerequisites

- Basic programming knowledge in any language (we'll use JavaScript/Python examples)
- Claude account (free tier works, Pro recommended for API features)
- VS Code installed (we'll configure everything together)
- Curiosity about AI-assisted development (no prior AI coding experience needed)

---

### Course Setup

To follow along, you'll need:

- Claude Pro or Team account for API access and Claude Code desktop app.
- VS Code with Continue extension for Claude integration.
- Node.js 18+ and Python 3.10+ for MCP server examples.
- GitHub account for workflow integration demos.
- Course repo: github.com/timothywarner-org/claude-dev-mastery
