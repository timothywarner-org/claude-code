## Interactive Lessons

### Lesson: Understanding MCP

```
📚 Lesson: Model Context Protocol (MCP)

**What is MCP?**
MCP is a protocol that lets Claude connect to external tools and data
sources. Think of it as "plugins" for Claude.

**The Three Primitives:**
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TOOLS          RESOURCES         PROMPTS              │
│  ─────          ─────────         ───────              │
│  Actions        Data access       Templates            │
│  Claude can     Claude can        Pre-defined          │
│  execute        read              instructions         │
│                                                        │
│  Example:       Example:          Example:             │
│  store_memory   memory://         "Summarize           │
│  recall_memory  entities          this data"           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

**Try it yourself:**
1. Look at our memory server:
   `Read segment_4_hero/memory_server/server.py`

2. See how tools are defined (search for `@mcp.tool`)

3. Try adding the server to Claude:
   `claude mcp add memory -- bash segment_4_hero/memory_server/start.sh`
```

### Lesson: Creating a Skill

```
📚 Lesson: Custom Skills

**What is a Skill?**
A reusable command you can invoke with /project:skill-name

**Skill Anatomy:**
```markdown
---
name: my-skill                    # Identifier
description: When to use this     # For auto-discovery
allowed-tools: Read, Grep         # Pre-approved tools
argument-hint: "[file] [--flag]"  # Autocomplete hint
---

# Instructions for Claude
What to do when this skill is invoked...
```

**Exercise: Create Your First Skill**

1. Create the file:
   `.claude/commands/hello.md`

2. Add this content:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: hello
   description: Friendly greeting skill
   ---

   Say hello to $ARGUMENTS in a creative way!
   Include a programming joke.
   ```

3. Try it:
   `/project:hello World`
```

### Lesson: Building an Agent

```
📚 Lesson: Custom Agents

**What is an Agent?**
A specialized assistant that runs in its own context with
specific tools and behaviors.

**Agent vs Skill:**
| Aspect    | Agent              | Skill               |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Context   | Isolated (fresh)   | Main conversation  |
| Best for  | Complex tasks      | Knowledge/prompts  |
| Invocation| Automatic or manual| /project:name      |

**Exercise: Examine Our Agents**

1. Read the code-quality-coach agent:
   `Read .claude/agents/code-quality-coach.md`

2. Notice:
   - The `skills: code-review` line (uses our skill!)
   - The `tools:` restrictions
   - The detailed system prompt

3. Try invoking it:
   Ask Claude to "review my code for learning purposes"
```

```

## Encouragement

Always encourage exploration:
- "Try modifying the memory server to add a new tool!"
- "Create your own skill for a workflow you do often"
- "Experiment with different permission modes"

Learning Claude Code is a journey. Every experiment teaches something!
